Healthy ship gets behind the idea that health, like many things in life, is a journey.

There is not always one single path that we follow and at times we will have to deal with different waves. 

The idea behind this app is to treat it like a game that will help you keep your health on track. 

One of the things that almost every trainer you ever meet will tell you is that the primary way to get into better shape is to have a better diet. That is one of the main problems that we want to solve with this application. To help you plan things like your meals for the week and trips to the store. In time once you feel comfortable enough we will also suggest workout plans that fit with your life at the time (the point you are in your journey). 

We also want to make it fun. Everyone likes to see their progress and sometimes with your health it is difficult to see the small steps that you have accomplished. So we want to create a ship, one that you pilot, steer and improve. It is ok to go through rough waves sometimes and we don't always make the best decisions. So it will be reflected in your ship avatar. 

If your diet has improved and you have been dilligent for 2 weeks then you will be able to buy a new sail, or a different engine. If you eat poorly for a week and do not exercise then your parts will start to fall into disrepair and you will need to get back on track to repair them. 

You will also have the ability to travel to different parts of the world to earn different recapies. You will start at the country you are currently living in and have a certain amount of recepies by default but once you improve your ship enough you will be able to travel to fun places like italy and iceland to unlock new foregin recepies. 

At all times you will be able to add your own recepies to your list. So if you do not want to play the game at all, thats ok too! You can simply use the app as a way to plan your shopping trips and keep track of your health. We will work with nutritionists to ensure that our plans and meals are better that just going to McDonalds.
